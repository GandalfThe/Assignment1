**Yongwook Kwon**
My name is Yongwook Kwon and you can just call me Jeremy. I'm a third year in Computer Science.
Some of my hobbies include watching movies, playing games, as well as playing and watching some sports. I really love Spiderman and maybe one of my favorite quotes from the movie is
> With great power comes great responsibility.

Maybe I'll add a bit more about my favorite movies and video games.
Not in any particular order, I love all of the Dark Souls series Video games:
- Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition
- Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin
- Dark Souls 3
- Demon Souls
- Bloodborne

But for movies, I specifically like the Spiderman series in this order:
1. Spiderman 1
2. Spiderman Into the Spiderverse
3. Spiderman 2
4. The Amazing Spiderman
5. The Amazing Spiderman 2
6. Spiderman 3

###Basic Git###
Just to clear my memory and so that I don't forget, here are some basic git commands:
```
git checkout
git push
git add
```

Similarly, here's a link to the [Github Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-an-empty-repository) so I know where to look when I forget something about Git commands.

Here's just a simple relative link to my [README.md](../README.md) file that doesn't really contain anything yet. Maybe I'll add some descriptions and information later on.

So now, I think I'm done with my assignments so I'll try checking them off in a list:
- [x] Headings
- [x] Styling Text
- [x] Quoting Text
- [x] Quoting Code
- [x] External Link
- [x] Section Link
- [x] Relative Link
- [x] Ordered and Unordered List
- [x] Task List
